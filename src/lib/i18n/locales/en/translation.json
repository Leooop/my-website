    "content": "<par> I discovered the world of programming in 2015 during my very first undergraduate computer science course. The power of this tool immediately fascinated me, and I have continuously explored the breadth of this field and refined my skills ever since. Throughout my academic journey in geophysics, I worked extensively on data analysis and modeling, where computational tools play a central role.</par><par>A PhD in mechanical modeling further strengthened my expertise in handling complex computational challenges. After completing it, I decided to venture into web development, driven by a passion for creating impactful solutions. I embarked on developing a web application in the finance sector, immersing myself in learning the fundamental web technologies and the MERN stack.</par><par>This unique combination of scientific rigor and practical web development experience has equipped me with a diverse skill set. My background in computational science ensures a strong foundation in problem-solving and analytical thinking, while my practical experience with web technologies demonstrates my ability to deliver robust and scalable applications.</par><par>I am eager to leverage my interdisciplinary knowledge and technical skills to contribute to innovative projects, bring ideas to life, and continue evolving as a software engineer.</par>"
